Processing Project Membership Requests
**************************************

As a principal investigator of a project at the OLCF, you must approve (or reject) every potential
user that requests membership on your project. myOLCF provides a mechanism for processing these
requests via the "For My Approval" page.

1. Click the "For My Approval" link in the "My Account" top navigation dropdown:
