System Overview
===============

Ascent is a stand-alone 18-node system with the same architecture and design
as Summit. It's most often utilized as a resource for OLCF training events,
workshops, and conferences. Ascent exists in the NCCS Open Security Enclave,
which is subject to fewer restrictions than the Moderate Security Enclave that
houses systems such as Summit. This means that participants in training events can go through a streamlined version of the approval process before being granted access.

As the Ascent user environment is almost identical to Summit, additional
information can be found in the :ref:`training-system-ascent` section of the
:ref:`summit-user-guide`.
